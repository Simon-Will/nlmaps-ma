# Querying OpenStreetMap in English

In the course of my Master’s thesis at Heidelberg University’s Department of
Computational Linguistics, I am building an English Language Interface for
OpenStreetMap, which you can see in action at
[https://nlmaps.gorgor.de/](https://nlmaps.gorgor.de/).

You can help us improve the system while at the same time contributing to an
open dataset ([CC BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/))!

This study is supported by Prof. Dr. Stefan Riezler and his [Statistical Natural
Language Processing Group](https://www.cl.uni-heidelberg.de/statnlpgroup/).

## The Annotation Job

Imagine you are asking _“Tell me spots near Brandenburg Gate in Berlin where I
can play table tennis!”_ and the system mistakenly looks for places with the
OpenStreetMap tag `sport=tennis`. Then it will be your job to tell the system to
look for places tagged `sport=table_tennis` instead.

If the system gets it right from the beginning, you will just have to tell it
that it was right. This will also count as an annotation.

## Your Skills

We expect that you have good English skills and a basic familiarity
with OpenStreetMap.

## The Pay

We are going to pay 150 € for 400 annotations. At 45 annotations per hour, this
will take you less than 10 hours (already including a tutorial to get you
started).

You can also do 200 annotations for 75 € instead.

## Contact

**By 4 April 2021**, send an informal email to Simon Will via
[will@cl.uni-heidelberg.de](mailto:will@cl.uni-heidelberg.de) if you are
interested in taking part in the annotation project. The annotations should be
finished until 15 April 2021. If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate
to ask.

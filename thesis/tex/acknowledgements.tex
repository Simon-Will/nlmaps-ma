% TODO: Where does the money come from?

I want to thank my supervisor Prof.~Dr.~Stefan Riezler for always being ready to
discuss the state of my work, for providing me with helpful guidance about which
approaches to pursue and for his help in finding relevant related work.
Additionally, I want to thank him for making the annotation experiment possible
by financially enabling it with funds from the Google-supported project
\enquote{Learning to Negotiate Answers in Multi-Pass Semantic Parsing}.

Furthermore, I also want to thank Raphael Schumann and especially Michael
Staniek for valuable comments on the ongoing research in numerous discussion
sessions. Michael also made his parsing model available to me, which was used as
one of the foundations of this thesis. An even more integral foundation is of
course Carolin Lawrence’s pioneering work on NLMaps, without which this thesis
would not exist today.

Finally, I would like to acknowledge the great work of the motivated annotators
from all over the world who participated in my annotation project, including the
OSM mappers Benjámin Zachár, Mateusz Konieczny, Rabin Ojha. Especially Mateusz
and another very experienced mapper (here unnamed) were a great help in
debugging issues with the web interface, in discussing finer points of OSM
tagging questions and by providing valuable hints for how to improve NLMaps in
the future.
